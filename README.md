# Unit 02 HTML, CSS, and Git Homework: Portfolio
This site build was inspired by the course work's focus on both float and position. I used positioning to vertically/horizontally align the content with the larger structural images. I've also included several positioned elements to jokingly annotate the imagery. The responsiveness was done based on where the design broke as opposed to using predefined measurements a la bootstrap, but ironically the values came out pretty close to those values.
